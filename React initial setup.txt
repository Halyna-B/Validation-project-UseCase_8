My next steps:
- Install redux/react-redux for state management
- Configure Store: Create a store for the application to store first name, last name, email and message.

Let's proceed with the installation of redux and react-redux for state management, and then create a store for the application.

Step 1: Install redux and react-redux

If you have not installed redux already in the previous steps, please do so with the following command:

bash
Copy code
npm install redux
Then, install react-redux, which allows you to connect your React components with the Redux store:

bash
Copy code
npm install react-redux
Step 2: Configure the Store

Next, let's create the Redux store. First, create a new directory in the src directory of your project named redux. Inside this directory, create two more directories: actions and reducers.

bash
Copy code
mkdir -p src/redux/actions src/redux/reducers
In src/redux/reducers, create a new file named userReducer.js:

javascript
Copy code
const initialState = {
  firstName: '',
  lastName: '',
  email: '',
  message: ''
};

const userReducer = (state = initialState, action) => {
  switch(action.type) {
    case 'UPDATE_USER':
      return {
        ...state,
        ...action.payload
      };
    default:
      return state;
  }
};

export default userReducer;
This reducer initializes the state of your application with an object that has firstName, lastName, email, and message properties. when it receives an action of type 'UPDATE_USER', it merges the action's payload into the state.

In src/redux/actions, create a new file named userActions.js:

javascript
Copy code
export const updateUser = (user) => {
  return {
    type: 'UPDATE_USER',
    payload: user
  };
};
This is an action creator function. It takes a user object as an argument and returns an action that has this object as its payload.

Finally, create a new file named store.js in the src/redux directory:

javascript
Copy code
import { createStore } from 'redux';
import userReducer from './reducers/userReducer';

const store = createStore(userReducer);

export default store;
This file creates the Redux store with your userReducer.

Remember to import the Provider component from react-redux and pass the store to it in your main src/index.js file:

javascript
Copy code
import React from 'react';
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom';
import { Provider } from 'react-redux';
import store from './redux/store';
import App from './App';

ReactDOM.render(
  <React.StrictMode>
    <Provider store={store}>
      <App />
    </Provider>
  </React.StrictMode>,
  document.getElementById('root')
);
The Provider component makes the Redux store available to any nested components that access it through the connect function (or useSelector hook).

Commit and push your changes to GitHub:

bash
Copy code
git add .
git commit -m "Configure Redux store"
git push origin main
You now have a Redux store in your React app and a reducer for handling user data. in the next steps, you'll create React components that read from and dispatch actions to the Redux store.
